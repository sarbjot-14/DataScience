# Unlabeled Weather

A program to predict the canadian city based on a given weather data.


# Inputs and Outputs

## Inputs:
	- monthly-data-labelled.csv  (data to train ML model)
	- monthly-data-unlabelled.csv (data to make predictions on)

## Ouputs:
	- labels.csv  (the predictions for the unlabelled data in monthly-data-unlabelled.csv)

## Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone down this repository.

Installation:

Most of the libraries needed can be found in Anaconda which can be downloaded from: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

Run the program:

`python3 weather_city.py monthly-data-labelled.csv monthly-data-unlabelled.csv labels.csv`


## Reflection

  - This was an assignment for Data Science class
  - assignment was pretty straight forward and did not take too long
	- It was a little bit hard to pick a machine learning model that would be good for this situation. Ended up with Support Vector Machine learning model that did a good job splitting and catagorizing the cities
	- The model had a score of about 80 percent, which I would say is acceptable because some cities have very close weathers becuase of proximity.
	- Here is the cities the model got wrong:
